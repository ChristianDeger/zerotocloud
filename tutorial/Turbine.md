This part of the tutorial is not done. 
For turbine to be effective it needs a stream of events from Hystrix, and so far we haven't started any applications that use Hystrix.
The kick-start turbine, we'd suggest looking at the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/recipes-rss" target="_blank">recipe-rss</a> project.
It provide a multi-tiered project that incorporates a few @netflixoss libraries including Hystrix.
