# Zero To Cloud With @NetflixOSS

Netflix has released a multitude of tools and applications to help in using the Cloud. Being infrastructure, they are
more difficult to setup that just consuming a client library like a JAR in Central. In general, each application
can run independently, but they work better together. This tutorial is focused on bringing up the @NetflixOSS stack
 on a fresh AWS account, in a similar style to how Netflix does it internally. 

We are actively tuning the steps and will post the specific steps here for OSCON 2014.
